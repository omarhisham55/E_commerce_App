# E-Commerce App
The app targets people who are looking to buy high quality furniture products for their house e.g : cupboards, chairs. And it targets merchants that sell furniture products to enable them to spread their markets and put their products online so everyone can check them out and order them.

# Libraries and technologies used
- Navigation component : one activity contains multiple fragments instead of creating multiple activities.
- Firebase Auth : Manging Accounts/ Logging in and Registrations.
- Firebase Firestore : Database for the system.
- Firebase Storage : To store products images and user profile pictures.
- MVVM & LiveData : Separate logic code from views and save the state in case the screen configuration changes.
- Coroutines : do some code in the background.
- view binding : instead of inflating views manually view binding will take care of that.
- Glide : Catch images and load them in imageView.
